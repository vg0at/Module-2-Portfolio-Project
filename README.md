## Module 2 Portfolio Project: Boredom Cure
A simple app that utilizes the Bored API to display an activity that will (hopefully) cure your boredom.

Functionality is still being added to this app. Stay tuned for future updates!

To use this app, simply click [this link](https://animated-wisp-d6cf27.netlify.app/) which will take you to the deployed website.

Clicking "Boredom Cure" on the top left corner will refresh the landing page. 

A way to add searched activities to the unordered list is currently being worked on, and will be implemented soon!

The app is quite self explanatory - you can retrieve a random activity by clicking the "Random activity" button, or you can use search filters to get specific activities. Group of 3? All alone? Not in the mood for busywork? We hear you. 
There are countless activities to choose from. Get the cure you need for your boredom now!

A demo for this app can be watched [here.](https://youtu.be/zPwzoVW48zg)
